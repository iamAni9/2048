# 2048
2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle video game written by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. It was originally written in JavaScript and CSS over a weekend, and released on 9 March 2014 as free and open-source software. My project is just a clone of this original one that I developed in Unity.
